## Monkeylog

This will be an open-source repository meant for lifting them weights. This project is an online only webapplication in which you can log and track your gym sessions. This enables the user to have a very clear picture on how their fitness journey is going. They can get these insights by checking out the metrics the logger collects while you are working out.

## Technologies

Frontend is a SPA that is primarily designed for the phone. This client is written in React and the server is running Kotlin + Spring Boot.

## Installation

With docker you can simply run this command to get the complete stack running locally.

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

## QA

**- Why another fitness logger**

The original reason was that none of the loggers I found supported programming. Which now there is a plethora of them supporting this feature. However I hated that they all had subscriptions blocking the useful insights. This lit a passion in me to just build my own application.

**- Why is it not a native mobile application**

I like web application to much.
